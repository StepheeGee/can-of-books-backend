### Cooperative
Make a list of each person’s strengths.

How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?
In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?
Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?

### Conflict Resolution

1. **Unequal Contribution**: 
   - **Assessment:** The team needs an honest discussion about workload distribution. Understanding why one person is doing most of the work is crucial. Is it due to skill gaps, lack of motivation, or something else?
   - **Communication:** Open dialogue is key. Express concerns respectfully and allow the less-contributing member to voice their thoughts. This can reveal underlying issues or barriers.
   - **Reassignment of Tasks:** Redistribute tasks based on strengths and interests. Providing clear roles and responsibilities can encourage equal contribution.

2. **Dominating Team Member**:
   - **Team Meeting:** A team discussion is necessary to address this issue. Highlight the importance of collaboration and the detrimental effects of one person taking over.
   - **Encourage Participation:** Ensure that everyone has an opportunity to contribute. Facilitate brainstorming sessions or assign specific sections of the project to different team members.
   - **Feedback and Encouragement:** Give positive feedback when someone steps back to allow others to contribute. It reinforces the value of collaboration.

3. **Skill and Understanding Differences**:
   - **Acknowledge Differences:** Recognize that each team member brings unique skills and experiences to the table. Embrace diversity in skills and knowledge.
   - **Learning Environment:** Create an environment where learning and skill development are encouraged. Pairing team members with varying skill levels for tasks can facilitate knowledge sharing.
   - **Support and Guidance:** Offer support and guidance to bridge skill gaps. Encourage the sharing of knowledge and resources among team members.
